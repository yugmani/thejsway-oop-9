  <h1>Understand object-oriented programming</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong>, or <strong>OOP</strong>, is
      a programming paradigm that uses objects containing both data and behavior
      to create programs.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <code><em>class</em></code> is an object-oriented abstraction for an
      idea or a concept manipulated by a program. It offers a convenient syntax
      to create objects representing this concept.
    </li>
    <li>
      A JavaScript class is defined with the
      <code><em>class</em></code> keyword. It can only contain
      <strong>methods</strong>. The <code><em>constructor()</em></code> method,
      called during object creation, is used to initialize the object, often by
      giving it some data properties. Inside methods, the
      <code><em>this</em></code> keyword represents the object on which the
      method was called.
    </li>
    <li>
      Objects are created from a class with the
      <code><em>new</em></code> operator. It calls the class constructor to
      initialize the newly created object.
    </li>
    <li>
      JavaScript's OOP model is based on <strong>prototypes</strong>. Any
      JavaScript object has an internal property which is a link (a
      <strong>reference</strong>) to another object: its prototype. Prototypes
      are used to share properties and delegate behavior between objects.
    </li>
    <li>
      When trying to access a property that does not exist in an object,
      JavaScript tries to find this property in the
      <strong>prototype chain</strong> of this object by first searching its
      prototype, then its prototype's own prototype, and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are several ways to create and link JavaScript objects through
      prototypes. One is to use the
      <code><em>Object.create()</em></code> method.
      <p>
        <code
          >// Create an object linked to myPrototypeObject const myObject =
          Object.create(myPrototypeObject);</code
        >
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      The JavaScript <code><em>class</em></code> syntax is another, arguably
      more convenient way to create relationships between objects.It emulates
      the class-based OOP model found in languages like C++, Java or C#. It is,
      however, just <strong>syntactic sugar</strong> on top of JavaScript's own
      prototype-based OOP model.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Under the hood: objects and prototypes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      To create relationships between objects, JavaScript uses
      <strong>prototypes</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      In addition to its own particular properties, any JavaScript object has an
      internal property which is a link (known as a reference) to another object
      called its <strong>prototype</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      When trying to access a property that does not exist in an object,
      JavaScript tries to find this property in the prototype of this object.
    </li>
    <li>
      This type of relationship between JavaScript objects is called
      <mark>delegation</mark>
      an object delegates part of its operation to its prototype.
    </li>
    <li>
      JavaScript's object-oriented model is based on prototypes, not classes, to
      share properties and delegate behavior between objects. In JavaScript, a
      class is itself an object, not a static blueprint. "Instantiating" a class
      creates a new object linked to a prototype object.
    </li>
    <li>
      The JavaScript class syntax is merely a more convenient way to create
      relationships between objects through prototypes. Classes were introduced
      to emulate the class-based OOP model on top of JavaScript's own
      prototype-based model. It's an example of what programmers call syntactic
      sugar.
